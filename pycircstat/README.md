**PyCircStat: circular statistics with Python**

This toolbox contains descriptive and inferential statistics for circular data.

Note: The toolbox is currently in  development. Many functions are working, but many are yet to come. We encourage you to start using the toolbox and provide feedback on bugs, features you would like and so on.

Until there is a dedicated article describing the toolbox, please credit this web page. 

Team: Philipp Berens, Fabian Sinz
