   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pycircstat's documentation!
======================================

All functions take arguments in radians.
For a detailed description of arguments and outputs consult the help text of the respective functions.

The implementation follows in most cases 'Biostatistical Analysis' and all referenced equations and tables
are taken from this book, if not otherwise noted. In some cases, the other books were preferred for implementation
was more straightforward for solutions presented there.

If you have suggestions, bugs or feature requests or want to contribute code, please email us.

All functions in this toolbox were implemented with care and tested on the examples presented in
'Biostatistical Analysis' where possible. Nevertheless, they may contain errors or bugs, which may
affect the outcome of your analysis. We do not take responsibility for any harm coming from using
this toolbox, neither if it is caused by errors in the software nor if it is caused by its improper
